## Setup:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Background and Analysis:

In this project we will compare the fertility in developed vs developing countries. Using UN data we aim to draw conclusions based on a country's development and their fertility, contraceptive use, and infant survival rates. This will allow for an understanding of how human development may influence a society's perspective on sex and birth.

### Data:
Our data was taken from the UN database: http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx

How we got the Development (GDP per capita): UN Data --> World Development Indicators --> GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)

How we got the Fertility: UN Data --> World Fertility Data


### Our Research Questions:

Question 1: How do fertility rates differ in developed vs developing countries? (Aidan)


Question 2: How prevalent are contraceptives in developed countries vs developing countries? (Saba)


Question 3: How do ages of conception differ in developed vs developing countries? (Vidushi)

### Analysis:
Question 1:
There is a clear correlation in both developed and developing countries where there is an increase in GDP per Capita, you see a decrease in the rate of fertility. That is to say, in general, that citizens of more developed and wealthy countries tend to have fewer children than citizens of less developed and less wealthy countries. The difference in fertility is most apparent amongst developing countries. Countries with GDP per capitas near the development boundary of $12,000 USD, have fertility rates (~2 to 4) dramatically lower than those at the very bottom of the global GDP valuations (~5 to 7).
