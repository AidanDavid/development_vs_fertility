## Background and Analysis:

In this project we will compare the fertility in developed vs developing countries. Using UN data we aim to draw conclusions based on a country's development and their fertility, contraceptive use, and infant survival rates. This will allow for an understanding of how human development may influence a society's perspective on sex and birth.

# Data:
Our data was taken from the Un database: http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx

How we got the Development (GDP per capita): UN Data --> World Development Indicators --> GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)

How we got the Fertility: UN Data --> World Fertility Data


# Our Research Questions:

Question 1: How do fertility rates differ in developed vs developing countries? (Aidan)


Question 2: How prevalent are contraceptives in developed countries vs developing countries? (Saba)


Question 3: How do ages of conception differ in developed vs developing countries? (Vidushi)
