# development_vs_fertility

In this project we will compare the fertility in developed vs developing countries. Using UN data we aim to draw conclusions based on a country's development and their fertility, contraceptive use, and infant survival rates. This will allow for an understanding of how human development may influence a society's perspective on sex and birth.

Data:
Our data was taken from the Un database: http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx

How we got the Development (GDP per capita): UN Data --> World Development Indicators --> GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)

How we got the Fertility: UN Data --> World Fertility Data
